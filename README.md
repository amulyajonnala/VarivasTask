Varivas UI/UX Engineer Problem Statement


The code can be run with the help of localhost. I have not used any dependencies instead I have implemented web tool kits. The tools I have used are HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. I have implemented the horizontal code using CSS Flexbox and Javascript. In my opinion, JS code may not be required as flexbox can be used to add a scroll whenever/wherever necessary. I have implemented CSS Flexbox for layout as it is easy and one can get precisely what they are aiming.
